The objective is to create a machine learning model to predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account within East Africa. This also includes an Exploratory Data Analysis for the stated countries. These countries are Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda.

I used a Logistic Regression model and got a 87% prediction accuracy.

#### EDA
The relationship between the variables showed little correlation. Especially on variable differences such as  age, gender and location types.
We should therefore put as much effort in urban areas as there would be in rural areas.
